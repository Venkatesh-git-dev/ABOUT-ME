## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Venkatesh, and I'm currently learning web development. I'm interested in experimentation and exploring new technologies.

### Technologies

I'm currently focusing on JavaScript, and I'm looking forward to learning more about it. I'm also interested in other web technologies and frameworks.

### Projects

I don't have any open-source projects or contributions to highlight yet, but I'm working on some personal projects to improve my skills.

### Development Philosophy

I'm still figuring out my development philosophy, but I prefer to build things from scratch rather than using frameworks. I believe that this approach helps me better understand the underlying technologies and principles.

### Contact Me
