## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Venkatesh (you can call me Venkatesh9), and I'm currently learning web development. I'm interested in experimentation and exploring new technologies.

### Technologies

I'm familiar with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and I'm currently learning Node.js. I'm excited to continue developing my skills and building full-stack applications.

### Projects

I don't have any open-source projects or contributions to highlight yet, but I'm working on some personal projects to improve my skills.

### Development Philosophy

I prefer to build things from scratch rather than using frameworks. I believe that this approach helps me better understand the underlying technologies and principles.

### Contact Me

Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or want to collaborate on a project! You can email me at [k.venkatesh.rules@gmail.com](mailto:k.venkatesh.rules@gmail.com).
